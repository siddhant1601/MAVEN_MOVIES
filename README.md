# MAVEN_MOVIES

## Overview

The Maven Movie Database Analysis project aims to leverage SQL queries to explore and derive insights from the Maven Movie dataset. This dataset contains a comprehensive collection of information about movies, actors, customers, rentals, and more. By querying the database, various analytical questions are addressed, including actor details, customer behavior, movie attributes, and more. This project provides an opportunity to know more about SQL quries , extract valuable information, and gain insights into the Maven Movie database.

## Question Explored

1. Identify the primary keys and foreign keys in the Maven Movies database. Discuss the differences.
2. List all details of actors.
3. List all customer information from the database.
4. List different countries.
5. Display all active customers.
6. List all rental IDs for customers with ID 1.
7. Display all the films whose rental duration is greater than 5.
8. List the total number of films whose replacement cost is greater than $15 and less than $20.
9. Display the count of unique first names of actors.
10. Display the first 10 records from the customer table.
11. Display the first 3 records from the customer table whose first name starts with 'b'.
12. Display the names of the first 5 movies which are rated as 'G'.
13. Find all customers whose first name starts with "a".
14. Find all customers whose first name ends with "a".
15. Display the list of first 4 cities which start and end with 'a'.
16. Find all customers whose first name contains "NI" in any position.
17. Find all customers whose first name has "r" in the second position.
18. Find all customers whose first name starts with "a" and are at least 5 characters in length.
19. Find all customers whose first name starts with "a" and ends with "o".
20. Get the films with PG and PG-13 ratings using the IN operator.
21. Get the films with lengths between 50 to 100 using the BETWEEN operator.
22. Get the top 50 actors using the LIMIT operator.
23. Get the distinct film IDs from the inventory table.
